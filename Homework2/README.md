The folder david, nico and mike were only there for exploratory reasons. Please read only the HW2_main.ipynb to see our final answers. 
Since one could not save the maps or the plots in the Jupyter notebook, we invite you to click on the link on the "SOLUTION" part just bellow the question. If everything works fine you should be able to open the figure that we computed. 

Thank you very much.
